**dns-record:**  
As this module will be creating all the DNS records bundled by whatever criteria needed or considered (team responsible, environment, content provider, etc) will also be the most used.
DISCLAIMER: akamaitlc has been included but it's not yet usable with Terraform as it's read-only in Terraform, you can create it only via the Control Center UI: https://techdocs.akamai.com/terraform/docs/set-up-edgedns#3-create-a-dns-record
